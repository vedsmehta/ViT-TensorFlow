# ViT-TensorFlow ðŸ“„

A small little repo for my paper replication on ViTs. The original paper can be found here: 

[An Image is Worth 16x16 Words][https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf]

### Note:
This repository is not meant for development purposes and is only meant to show a small replica of a ViT.

## Usage
Download the cifar-100 dataset and unzip it. The dataset can be downloaded here:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf

In the same folder as your cifar-100, the repo and open it in your IDE of choice. Run the `demo.ipynb` file to see a ViT in action on the cifar-100 dataset.
If you want to see behind the scenes, feel free to check out `model.ipynb`.
