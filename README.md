# ViT-TensorFlow ðŸ“„

A small little repo for my paper replication on ViTs. The original paper can be found here: 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf


## Usage
1. Download the cifar-100 dataset and unzip it. The dataset can be downloaded here:
    https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

2. In the same folder as your cifar-100, clone the repo and open it in your IDE of choice. 
3. Run the [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) file to see a ViT in action on the cifar-100 dataset.
4. Play around with the hyperparameters to see how it impacts the size of the model, the time it takes to train the model, and the accuracy of the model.
5. If you want to see behind the scenes, feel free to check out [model.py](./model.py). 

### Notes:
> This repository is not meant for development purposes and is only meant to show a small replica of a ViT.

> Depending on the power and capability of your machine, it may take long to train the ViT
